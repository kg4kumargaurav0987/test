<h1 style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:20px;"><strong>COUNTABLE</strong><br /> <strong> REFERRAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h1>
<p>These Referral Terms and Conditions (“<strong>Terms</strong>” or this “<strong>Agreement</strong>”) govern the ability of referrers (each, a “<strong>Referrer</strong>”)  to receive commissions for successfully referring users to Countable Inc. (“<strong>Countable</strong>”)’s software, which may refer to either the paid version of the Software or the 30 day free trial (the “<strong>Free Trial</strong>”), as the case may be (the “<strong>Software</strong>”). This Agreement is deemed to be accepted once a Referrer participates in the referral program that is subject to the terms of this Agreement (“<strong>Referral Program</strong>”). Both a Referrer and Countable shall each be referred to as a “Party”, or “Parties” collectively.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, a person or company that the Referrer registers as a potential user of the Software through the PartnerStack software portal (“<strong>Partner Portal</strong>”) using the registration processes and procedures prescribed by Countable in its discretion from time to time shall be referred to as a “<strong>Registered Prospect</strong>”. </p>

<h4 style="padding-left: 60px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:20px;color:#0c71c3;"><strong>1 REFERRAL PROGRAM – REFERRAL FEE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.1 “<strong>Referral Fees on Qualifying Transactions. </strong>” Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Countable agrees to pay the Referrer a referral fee (the “<strong>Referral Fee</strong>”) on each qualifying transaction, which is defined to mean a transaction between Countable and a Registered Prospect for (a) the licensing of a Free Trial of the Software, (b) the purchase of one or more subscriptions or licenses to use the Software, and (c) the purchase of one or more additional subscriptions or licenses within twelve (12) months after the first qualifying transaction with the Registered Prospect  (each a “<strong>Qualifying Transaction</strong>”). For greater certainty, where a subscription to the Software is purchased by a Registered User, such transactions will not be deemed to be a Qualifying Transaction until the Subscription Fees are paid in full, and sales of licenses to any other software, support or professional services shall not be considered a Qualifying Transaction. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.2 “<strong>Amount of Referral Fees.</strong>” Where a Registered Prospect registers for a Free Trial via the Referral Program, Countable agrees to pay a Referral Fee in the amount of $100 per Qualifying Transaction, payable one month after the sign up date. Where a Registered Prospect purchases a subscription for the Software via the Referral Program, Countable agrees to pay a Referral Fee in the amount of $400 per Qualifying Transaction, payable two months after the paid subscription date. Where a Registered Prospect purchases a subscription of the Software via the Referral Program, the Referral Fee will not be payable unless and until Countable actually receives payment of the full amount of the fees in respect of a Qualifying Transaction payable to Countable by a Registered Prospect, not including any taxes or any shipping, handling or other charges, and net of all deductions for discounts, refunds, returns, rebates and charge backs (the “<strong>Subscription Fees</strong>”).
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.3 “<strong>Reduction of Subscription Fees.</strong>” If the Subscription Fees paid in respect of a Qualifying Transaction are reduced or eliminated, whether as a result of a discount, refund, return, rebate, charge back or for any other reason in Countable’s discretion, the Referral Fee in respect of the Subscription Fees will be adjusted accordingly. Countable does not represent, warrant, or guarantee, and is not required to pay, any minimum amount of Referral Fees to a Referrer. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.4 “<strong>Reports.</strong>” Reports of all accrued Referral Fees will be made available on the Partner Platform (each a “Report”). Within thirty (30) days after the end of each month or such other periods as agreed by the Parties from time to time (each a “<strong>Reporting Period</strong>”), Countable will review the particulars of each Report to ensure that it satisfies the criteria to be qualified as a Qualifying Transaction. 
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.5 “<strong>Payment of Referral Fees.</strong>” After Countable receives a Report and confirms that a reported transaction is a Qualifying Transaction, Countable shall pay the Referrer all applicable Referral Fees via the Platform, less all withholdings and deductions required by applicable law or authorized under this Agreement. 
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.6 “<strong>Taxes and Withholdings.</strong>” All taxes and government charges, including any penalties and interest, assessed or imposed by any jurisdiction (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”) will be borne by the Referrer and Countable will withhold such payments as required by law. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.7 “<strong>No Other Remuneration.</strong>”  Referral Fees (if any) are full and complete compensation for referrals by a Referrer and the Referrer’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement. Except for Referral Fees, the Referrer is not entitled to any other fees, commissions or other remuneration or reimbursements arising from, connected with, or relating to this Agreement, the Referral Program, referrals of Registered Prospects, Qualifying Transactions or any other transactions between Countable and Registered Prospects or any other person. </p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1.8 “<strong>No Obligation to Provide Support.</strong>” Countable shall have no obligation to provide the Referrer with technical and/or sales support or training. </p>
